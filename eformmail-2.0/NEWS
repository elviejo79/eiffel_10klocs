NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of eformmail


Release 2.0 - 2007-05-07

* Spam trap facility installed, so misuse of form by spammers has
  become impossible.

* Field names are now treated case-insensitively.


Release 1.0 - 2007-03-02

* Can now send email using SMTP, so sendmail does no longer need to be
  installed.
* The email address to which the email is sent, is no longer
  included in the To field. This avoids harvesting of this email
  address by programs that scan address books or email.
* Non zero exit codes by sendmail are now treated as an error.


Release 0.3 - 2006-05-30

* Fixed issue with only first part of error appearing in Apache's weblog.
